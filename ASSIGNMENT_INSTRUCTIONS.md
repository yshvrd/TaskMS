# Task: Internal Task & Management Dashboard

## Objective
Build a small internal management and task-tracking application that demonstrates your ability to develop both the frontend and backend, work with APIs, structure a project properly, and create reusable components and services.

The application should allow a team to create, manage, track, and view tasks from a central dashboard.



## Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Python + FastAPI or
- Node.js + Express

### Database
- PostgreSQL preferred
- SQLite is acceptable for the assignment



## Requirements

1. Dashboard

Create a dashboard showing:

- Total Tasks
- Pending Tasks
- In Progress Tasks
- Completed Tasks
- Overdue Tasks
- Tasks assigned to the current user

The dashboard should provide a quick overview of the team's work.



2. Task Management

Users should be able to:

- Create a task
- Edit a task
- Delete a task
- Assign a task to a team member
- Set task priority
- Set due date
- Change task status
- Add task description
- Add notes/comments

Suggested Statuses
- Pending
- In Progress
- Completed
- Blocked

Suggested Priorities
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Urgent



3. Task List

Create a task-management page containing:

- Task name
- Assigned user
- Priority
- Status
- Due date
- Created date
- Last updated date

Add:

- Search
- Status filter
- Priority filter
- Assignee filter
- Sorting
- Pagination

The filtering and pagination should preferably be handled through the backend API rather than loading all records into the frontend.



4. Backend API

Create REST APIs for the application.

Example endpoints:

```bash
GET    /api/tasks
GET    /api/tasks/{id}
POST   /api/tasks
PUT    /api/tasks/{id}
DELETE /api/tasks/{id}

GET    /api/users
POST   /api/users

GET    /api/dashboard

```


The task API should support parameters such as:

```bash
/api/tasks?status=in_progress
/api/tasks?priority=high
/api/tasks?assignee=12
/api/tasks?search=shopify
/api/tasks?page=1&limit=20
```

The API should include:

- Request validation
- roper HTTP status codes
- Error handling
- Pagination
- Filtering
- Search
- Database integration



5. Database

Create an appropriate database structure.

At minimum, include:

```bash 
Users
id
name
email
role
created_at
```

```bash
Tasks
id
title
description
status
priority
assigned_to
due_date
created_at
updated_at
```

```bash
Comments / Notes
id
task_id
user_id
comment
created_at
```

You should decide the appropriate relationships between these tables.



6. Reusable Code

This is an important part of the assignment.

The application should be structured so that code can easily be reused in future internal applications.

For example:

Frontend

Create reusable components such as:

- Button
- Modal
- Input
- Select
- Table
- Pagination
- StatusBadge
- PriorityBadge
- TaskCard

Backend

Separate reusable functionality such as:

- API routes
- Services
- Database models
- Repositories
- Validation schemas
- Authentication
- Utilities

Do not put the entire application inside one or two large files.



7. API Integration

Create at least one external API integration.

You can use any publicly available API.

For example:

GET /api/external/users

Fetch data from an external API and display it somewhere in the application.

The implementation should demonstrate that you understand:

API requests
Authentication/API keys where applicable
Error handling
Timeouts
API response processing
Rate-limit considerations



8. Task Details Page

Clicking a task should open a detailed view.

The page should display:

- Task information
- Current status
- Priority
- Assigned user
- Due date
- Description
- Comments/notes
- Activity/history if implemented

Users should be able to update the task from this page.



9. UI/UX

The application should look like a real internal business tool rather than a basic coding assignment.

Focus on:

- Clean layout
- Responsive design
- Easy navigation
- Clear status indicators
- Good spacing
- Consistent components
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Error states
- Confirmation before destructive actions

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.



10. Project Structure

The project should have a clean structure.

For example:
```bash
project/
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── utils/
│   │   └── App.jsx
│   └── ...
│
├── backend/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── schemas/
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── main.py
│
├── README.md
└── ...
```

The exact structure is up to you, but the application should clearly separate responsibilities.



## Bonus Features

These are optional and can be implemented if time permits:

- Login/authentication
- Role-based access
- Kanban task board
- Drag-and-drop tasks
- Task activity history
- File attachments
- Notifications
- Dark mode
- WebSocket/live task updates
- Docker setup
- Automated tests
- API documentation
- Background jobs
- Audit logs
